# Third-party notices and provenance

The private high-velocity Space-swipe technique is credited to jurplel/InstantSpaceSwitcher. Rheo (formerly Strafe Next)'s legacy/modern event shapes and the IOHID byte layout were derived from the supplied rileycx/strafe source (commit 37ec57e0dd7ae91c22225bc36bf5cd210ff9cba7), which credits joshuarli/iss for its macOS 27 payload implementation. This is not an original discovery of an Apple API or a supported Apple interface.

`tests/upstream/SwipeInterceptor.swift` is an unmodified upstream file retained to reproduce four control-flow defects. Its SHA-256 is recorded by the reproducer. The rest of the runtime is a new implementation, not an upstream-approved release.

The Dock AX overlay identifier approach (`mc` / `appexpose`) was reviewed in shawntz's upstream Strafe PR #8. The monitor here is independently written, with different conservative unknown-state handling. Credit for the prior approach remains with that contribution.

Upstream's entire combined license and acknowledgment text follows unchanged.

The instant space-switching technique that strafe implements — synthesizing a
high-velocity Dock-swipe CGEvent with near-zero progress, and intercepting the
user's real trackpad swipe via an active session event tap — was conceived and
first implemented by jurplel in InstantSpaceSwitcher:
